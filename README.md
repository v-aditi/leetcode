### What I've learnt:
- list() is a constructor that can convert strings into a list in linear time
- "".join() joins all items in an iterable object (list or dictionary) into a string with "" in between each item in linear time
- to improve memory useage, pop the elements from the array when adding to the string
- '.isalpha()' returns True if alphabet

## 

## General Notes
- try to account for edge cases before using recursion to reduce space and time complexity (especially when searching!!)

# Leetcode

## Arrays & Strings
### Questions: 
<strong> Easy </strong> <br>
- #917: Reverse only letters
- #1417: Reformat that string
- #35: Search insert position
- #20: Valid Parentheses

<strong> Questions To-do </strong> <br>
- #121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Easy)
- #217: Contains Duplications (Easy)
- #53: Maximum Subarray (Easy)
- #152: Maximum Product Subarray (Medium)
- #238: Product of Array Except Self (Medium)
- #153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)
- #33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)
- #15: 3Sum (Medium)
- #11: Container with Most Water (Medium)

### What I've learnt:
- list() is a constructor that can convert strings into a list in linear time
- "".join() joins all items in an iterable object (list or dictionary) into a string with "" in between each item in linear time
- to improve memory useage, pop the elements from the array when adding to the string
- '.isalpha()' returns True if alphabet

## Linked Lists
### Questions:
<strong> Easy </strong> <br>
- #206: Reverse linked list

<strong> Questions To-do </strong> <br>
- #141: Linked list cycle (Easy)
- #21: Merge two sorted lists (Easy)
- #19: Remove nth node from end of list (Medium)
- #143: Reorder list (Medium)
- #23: Merge k sorted lists (Hard)

### What I've learnt:
- O(1) time complexity for inserting and deleting nodes

## General Notes
- try to account for edge cases before using recursion to reduce space and time complexity (especially when searching!!)
- Iteration is faster and has better space complexity than recursion due to Python overheads

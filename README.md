#917, #1417

<strong>What I've learnt: </strong> <br>
- list() is a constructor that can convert strings into a list in linear time
- "".join() joins all items in an iterable object (list or dictionary) into a string with "" in between each item in linear time
- to improve memory useage, pop the elements from the array when adding to the string
- '.isalpha()' returns True if alphabet
